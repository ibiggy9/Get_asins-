# Get_asins
## Pulls information out of Amazon's downloadable ASIN file from Vendor Central

### What's an ASIN?
An ASIN is a unique identifier that Amazon assigns to each item they sell. If you are an e-commerce manager and work
with Amazon, you'll be familiar with this concept. 

### What's this do?
This script allows for the ingestion of asins in to python for subsequent processing. This can be helpful if you are building
scraping technologies around your ASINs.
